Example approach
1. Create a directory for Kubernetes to better organize the project.

# Create a main directory named "canary-deployments" with a k8s subdirectory.
$ mkdir ~/canary-deployments/k8s -p
2. Create a new file with the content of the app-stable-deployment.yaml asset.

$ nano ~/canary-deployments/k8s/app-stable-deployment.yaml
 
# Copy and paste the content of the app-stable-deployment.yaml asset
 
# Save the file and exit 
3. Apply the file to Kubernetes using kubectl

$ kubectl apply -f ~/canary-deployments/k8s/app-stable-deployment.yaml
deployment.apps/api-stable created
 
# Ensure that the pods were created
$ kubectl get pods
...
api-stable-cc7476bd8-9g9j2   1/1     Running   0          8s
api-stable-cc7476bd8-2f6cs   1/1     Running   0          8s
4. Create the ClusterIP that will allow other services to communicate with these pods.

# Create a new file for the service definition with the following content
$ nano ~/canary-deployments/k8s/app-stable-service.yaml
 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api-stable
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: api
    lifecycle: stable
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80 # Ensure port 80 is exposed for this service
      targetPort: 8080 # This is the container port, which runs on port 8080
 
# Save the file and exit
 
# Create the service
$ kubectl apply -f ~/canary-deployments/k8s/app-stable-service.yaml
service/api-stable created
 
# Check the service
$ kubectl get svc 
...
api-stable         ClusterIP   10.43.221.160   <none>        80/TCP    37m
5. Make sure the service works as expected, you can use kubectl port-forward to test this.

# This will port-forward port 80 from the service to port 8080 on your workspace.
$ kubectl port-forward service/api-stable 8080:80 --address='0.0.0.0'
Forwarding from 0.0.0.0:8080 -> 8080
Click on the webserver button to see the response from the service:


If everything went well, you should receive a response from the pods, through the service that you created. Please ensure that you can see a response that resembles the one below before moving forward.


Note: Ensure that you release port 8080 from your workspace by pressing CRTL+C, on your workspace, to exit the port-forward session.
