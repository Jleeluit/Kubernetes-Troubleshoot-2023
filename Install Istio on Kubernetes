Example approach
1. Create a directory to create a logical distinction between Istio and Kubernetes.

$ mkdir -p ~/canary-deployments/istio
 
# Ensure that you change to the new directory
cd ~/canary-deployments/istio
2. Download Istio 1.17.0 as described in the task.

$ curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.17.0 TARGET_ARCH=x86_64 sh -
...
Istio 1.17.0 Download Complete!
Istio has been successfully downloaded into the istio-1.17.0 folder on your system.
...
 
# Ensure the download was successful
$ ls
istio-1.17.0
3. Move the istioctl binary to /usr/local/bin  so that you can start with the installation

$ sudo mv ~/canary-deployments/istio/istio-1.17.0/bin/istioctl /usr/local/bin
 
# Ensure that you can interact with the istioctl tool
$ istioctl version
no running Istio pods in "istio-system"
1.17.0
4. Before installing Istio, you need to ensure that the custom config that was provided by the security team exists as a file, so that you can pass it to Istio during the installation. To do that, create a file in the  ~/canary-deployments/istio/ folder with the contents of the istio-security-config.yaml

$ nano ~/canary-deployments/istio/istio-security-config.yaml
# Paste the content of the asset istio-security-config.yaml
# Save the file and exit
5. Start the Istio installation and provide the custom config file that was provided by the security team.

$ istioctl install -f ~/canary-deployments/istio/istio-security-config.yaml -y
✔ Istio core installed                                                                                                                                                                             
✔ Istiod installed                                                                                                                                                                                 
✔ Ingress gateways installed                                                                                                                                                                       
✔ Installation complete                                                                                                                                                                            Making this installation the default for injection and validation.
6. To verify that the installation was successful, check the pods and services of the istio-system namespace. All pods should be running and a LoadBalancer type service - named istio-ingressgateway - should exist with its respective external IP.

$ kubectl  get pods,svc -n istio-system

Note: If for some reason the EXTERNAL-IP for the istio-ingressgateway appears as <pending> or <none> it's probably because the port 8080 on your namespace is in use. If that's the case, ensure that you stop any services that you might have started on port 8080.
