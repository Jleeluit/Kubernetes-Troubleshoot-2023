Example approach
One Kubernetes Ingress object can have many rules. To add a rule for marketing application, edit the existing ingress-nginx.yml file by using the following command

nano ingress-nginx.yml

Add the following lines under spec.rules.http.paths

      - path: /marketing
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: devsecops-marketing-clusterip
            port:
              number: 8222

This means, every traffic to http://<nginx-address>/marketing/... will be redirected to Kubernetes service devsecops-marketing-clusterip on port 8222, which is the marketing application created on the previous task.

Press CTRL+X (Windows) or command+X (Mac) to exit. When asked to save the file, type Y


And press Enter (Windows) or return (Mac) to save the modified file


Update the ingress rule by re-applying it using the following command

kubectl apply -f ingress-nginx.yml

You can now access the marketing application through Nginx. Try to hit the marketing endpoint using the command below

curl http://localhost/marketing/api/hello
You should get the response below from the marketing application


Make sure you can still access the loan application through Nginx. Try to hit the loan endpoint using the following command

curl http://localhost/loan/api/hello
You should get the following response from the loan application
