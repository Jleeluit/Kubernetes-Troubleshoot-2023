Example approach
Edit devsecops-loan.yml using the command below

nano devsecops-loan.yml

Reduce the replica to one and remove (or comment) the LoadBalancer service section as you already use ClusterIP to expose the loan application.


Press CTRL+X (Windows) or command+X (Mac) to exit. When asked to save the file, type Y


And press Enter (Windows) or return (Mac) to save the modified file


Apply the yml file using the terminal command below. The loan application deployment will be updated

kubectl apply -f devsecops-loan.yml

Download and extract the reference code (file devsecops-nginx-04.zip) from the task reference code. You will have the file devsecops-marketing.yml. Create a yml file for Kubernetes declarative configuration using the following command

nano devsecops-marketing.yml

Copy the content of extracted devsecops-marketing.yml into your new file

There are two Kubernetes objects defined on the devsecops-marketing.yml file:

deployment devsecops-marketing-deployment (red rectangle below) uses the docker image timpamungkas:/devsecops-marketing:1.0.0 for the pod image (yellow rectangle below). The pod is exposed at port 8222 (blue rectangle below). For pod health check (readiness & liveness), use the particular endpoints (green rectangles below). There will be one pod replica (purple rectangle below).


The service devsecops-marketing-clusterip exposes the pod to port 8222 on host.


Create Kubernetes objects by applying the yml file using the terminal command below. All two objects will be created.

kubectl apply -f devsecops-marketing.yml

To make sure all pods are re-created, restart the deployment using the following command

kubectl rollout restart deployment -n devsecops

Wait for around 3 minutes until the pod is ready. Verify that there is one loan pod and one marketing pod. They must be READY before continuing. Use this terminal command to check:

kubectl get pod -n devsecops

Make sure there are two ClusterIP services, one for loan and one for marketing. Use the following command

kubectl get services -n devsecops
