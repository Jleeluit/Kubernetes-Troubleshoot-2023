Example approach
Download and extract the reference code (file devsecops-nginx-01.zip) from the task reference code. You will have the file devsecops-loan.yml.

Create a yml file for Kubernetes declarative configuration using the following command

nano devsecops-loan.yml

Copy the content of extracted devsecops-loan.yml into your new file

kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name:  devsecops

Press CTRL+X (Windows) or command+X (Mac) to exit. When asked to save the file, type Y


And press Enter (Windows) or return (Mac) to save the modified file


There are three Kubernetes objects defined on the devsecops-loan.yml file:

namespace devsecops; you will work here instead of using the default (no namespace)


deployment devsecops-loan-deployment (red rectangle below) uses the docker image timpamungkas:/devsecops-loan:1.0.0 for the pod image (yellow rectangle below). The pod is exposed at port 8111 (blue rectangle below). For pod health check (readiness & liveness), use the particular endpoints (green rectangles below). There will be two pod replicas (purple rectangle below).


The service devsecops-loan-loadbalancer exposes the pod to port 8111 on host. The LoadBalancer Kubernetes service means that Kubernetes will create a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across the pod replicas labeled with app.kubernetes.io/name: devsecops-loan. In this case, there are two pod replicas.


Create Kubernetes objects by applying the yml file using the terminal command below. All three objects will be created.

kubectl apply -f devsecops-loan.yml

Wait for around 3 minutes until the pod is ready. Verify that both pods are READY before continuing. Use this terminal command to check:

kubectl get pod -n devsecops

Note : sometimes it might take longer than 3 minutes for the pods to be ready

Hit the endpoint /loan/api/hello several times. Use this terminal command (several times):

curl --location 'http://localhost:8111/loan/api/hello'
Notice that the load balancer will redirect traffic to one of pod randomly, so you will get response from either loan pod 1 or loan pod 2:
