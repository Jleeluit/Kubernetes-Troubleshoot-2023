Example approach
Since you need to create different rules for loan and marketing, you must use two separated ingress rules. Delete the existing ingress rules.

You can find the ingress rule name by using the following command

kubectl get ingress -n devsecops

Then delete the ingress rule by using command kubectl delete ingress -n devsecops <ingress-rule-name>

So in this case, you can use:

kubectl delete ingress -n devsecops devsecops-ingress-nginx
To generate a basic username/password, you need to install apache2-utils using this command:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apache2-utils


Generate the username marketing-auth and use password marketing-password. Use htpasswd command like below:

htpasswd -c auth marketing-user

This will generate a file named auth on the current folder

From the generated auth file, create a Kubernetes secret with the name marketing-auth in the namespace devsecops. Use the command below

kubectl create secret generic marketing-auth -n devsecops --from-file=auth

Create a new file for the loan's ingress rule using the below command

nano ingress-nginx-loan.yml

Download and extract the reference code (file devsecops-nginx-08.zip) from the task resources. Copy and paste the content of extracted yml file into your own ingress-nginx-loan.yml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  namespace: devsecops
  name: devsecops-ingress-nginx-loan
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: devsecops-ingress-nginx-loan
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "3"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rpm: "4"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-burst-multiplier: "1"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /loan
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: devsecops-loan-clusterip
            port:
              number: 8111
Press CTRL+X (Windows) or command+X (Mac) to exit. When asked to save the file, type Y


And press Enter (Windows) or return (Mac) to save the modified file



The ingress must have a specific name and label since you will have a dedicated ingress for the loan. Use the name devsecops-ingress-nginx-loan

Set timeout to 3 seconds

Set rate limit to 4 requests per minute. Total rate limit is limit-rpm * limit-burst-multiplier

This ingress rule will be applied only to the traffic going to /loan/...

Create a new file for marketing's ingress rule (not secured) using the command below

nano ingress-nginx-marketing.yml

From the extracted reference code (file devsecops-nginx-08.zip), copy and paste the content of extracted yml file into your own ingress-nginx-marketing.yml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  namespace: devsecops
  name: devsecops-ingress-nginx-marketing
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: devsecops-ingress-nginx-marketing
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /marketing
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: devsecops-marketing-clusterip
            port:
              number: 8222
Press CTRL+X (Windows) or command+X (Mac) to exit. When asked to save the file, type Y


And press Enter (Windows) or return (Mac) to save the modified file



The ingress must have a specific name and label since you will have a dedicated ingress for marketing. Use the name devsecops-ingress-nginx-marketing

This ingress rule will be applied only to the traffic going to /loan/...

No annotations are defined in this ingress rule meaning no specific configuration is applied for /marketing/..., hence the ingress rule will only follow the global rule specified on Task 6

Create a new file for the marketing's ingress rule (secured with a username/password) using the following command

nano ingress-nginx-marketing-auth.yml

From the extracted reference code (file devsecops-nginx-08.zip), copy and paste the content of extracted yml file into your own ingress-nginx-marketing-auth.yml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  namespace: devsecops
  name: devsecops-ingress-nginx-marketing-auth
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: devsecops-ingress-nginx-marketing-auth
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-type: basic
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-secret: devsecops/marketing-auth
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /marketing/api/delay
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: devsecops-marketing-clusterip
            port:
              number: 8222
Press CTRL+X (Windows) or command+X (Mac) to exit. When asked to save the file, type Y


And press Enter (Windows) or return (Mac) to save the modified file



The ingress must have a specific name and label since you will have a dedicated ingress for specific endpoint in marketing. Use the name devsecops-ingress-nginx-marketing-auth (there is -auth to differentiate from the marketing ingress on the previous step)

This ingress rule requires a basic authentication type (username/password), where the credentials will be taken from the Kubernetes secret on the namespace devsecops, with the secret name marketing-auth (defined previously on Step 4)

This ingress rule will be applied only to the traffic going to /marketing/api/delay.... Since the endpoint is more specific then the previous ingress rule (Step 6), this ingress rule will take precedence.

Apply all three ingress rules

kubectl apply -f ingress-nginx-loan.yml
kubectl apply -f ingress-nginx-marketing.yml
kubectl apply -f ingress-nginx-marketing-auth.yml
